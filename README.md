# JJHack
**MOD IS MADE ESPECIALLY FOR AntiAnarchyFixes (1.17)**

I've been doing this skid just for learning more about Java and hacking in general, i'm a total newfag and have no knowledge about what i'm doing so
pls dont be serious about this mod

This mod is focused on a Brazilian anarchy server (Anarkcraft), so i will try my best to show every exploit that i find

## Modules & Bypasses
First of all, there's NO ACTUALL bypass (at least for now)
The new/modified modules are: elytra fly, and JNewChunks.
### Elytra Fly changes:
   - Bypass on limit of your elytra's speed (you will go ~0.02 faster);
   - Faster Elytra fly on AnarchyExploitsFixes anti Elytra
        By checking the screen where it says if player is able to go faster or not;
        Or by time checking if player is able to go faster;
### New Chunks
    - Theres nothing special in JJMeteor new chunks, It shows chunks where someone else has walked on;

and of course, i would like to receive advices (without telling me im a stupid simpson's monkey or smth)
